# RGDS AI Governance (Covenants)
**Human-Governed AI Boundaries for Regulated Gate Decision Support (RGDS)**

This repository defines **explicit governance covenants** for the use of AI in regulated, phase-gated decision environments.

It is published as part of an **independent case study** on decision defensibility and human accountability in complex, regulated delivery contexts (e.g., biopharma, life sciences, and other compliance-driven industries).

This repository is intentionally **principles-first** and **non-operational**.

## What This Repository Is (and Is Not)

### This is:
- a governance reference defining explicit boundaries for AI assistance
- a human-governed framework for constrained AI use in regulated decisions
- compatible with audit, quality review, and phase-gate approval expectations
- designed to operate alongside decision systems such as RGDS

### This is not:
- an autonomous or agentic AI system
- an AI implementation or tooling repository
- a delivery playbook or enforcement mechanism
- regulatory or legal advice

No AI described here is permitted to silently decide, approve, defer, or accept risk.

## Why This Exists

In regulated environments, failures rarely stem from lack of intelligence.

They stem from:
- unclear ownership
- implicit assumptions
- undocumented risk acceptance
- decisions that cannot be reconstructed later

Public industry discussions—including openly available webinars, articles, and conference materials hosted by firms such as **Syner-G**—have consistently surfaced these challenges in the context of AI adoption:

- decision paralysis at phase gates
- fragmented evidence across functions
- late discovery of misalignment
- risk-averse stakeholders unsure how AI fits into regulated workflows

This repository responds to those *publicly discussed challenges* by formalizing a governance posture in which AI is:

- optional
- constrained
- auditable
- subordinate to human judgment

---

## Governance Stance (Core Principles)

### 1. AI is never a decision-maker

AI systems may support analysis, but **cannot**:

- initiate decisions
- approve, reject, or defer outcomes
- override human judgment
- act autonomously or agentically

All decisions remain **human-owned**.

---

### 2. AI assistance must be explicit and reviewable

When used, AI outputs must be:

- intentionally invoked by a human
- reviewable and editable
- attributable to a specific decision context
- explicitly approved or rejected by a named human owner

There is no path for silent or implicit influence.

---

### 3. Governance is separated from decision structure

This repository defines **AI governance boundaries only**.

Decision systems such as **RGDS (Regulated Gate Decision Support)** define *how* decisions are recorded, evaluated, and owned.

This separation ensures that:
- decisions remain valid without AI
- AI use remains inspectable and reversible
- governance can evolve independently of delivery tooling

Every governed decision must remain defensible **if all AI outputs are removed**.

## Repository Contents

- **Non-Agentic AI Contract**  
  Formal statement of explicit prohibitions and required human ownership

- **What AI Will Not Do**  
  Executive- and client-facing clarification designed to reduce adoption risk

- **Service-Line Governance Overview**  
  How constrained AI assistance fits into regulated consulting and delivery contexts

Internal enforcement mechanisms, operational playbooks, and delivery-specific procedures are intentionally **out of scope** for this public repository.

---

## Intended Audience

This repository is written for:

- Program and delivery leaders in regulated environments
- Quality, governance, and risk stakeholders
- Executives responsible for phase-gate approvals
- Consultants and analysts designing AI-assisted workflows

It assumes familiarity with regulated delivery—not machine-learning research.

---

## Status

This repository is a **reference governance artifact**, not a production system.

It is published to support transparency, discussion, and defensible design—not to prescribe implementation.
