# RGDS AI Governance  
**Human-Governed AI Boundaries for Regulated Decision Support**

This repository defines **explicit governance boundaries** for the use of AI in regulated, phase-gated decision environments.

It is published as part of an **independent case study** on decision defensibility and human accountability in complex, regulated delivery contexts (e.g., biopharma, life sciences, and other compliance-driven industries).

---

## What this repository is

This repository provides:

- Clear, written constraints on how AI may assist human decision-makers  
- Explicit prohibitions against autonomous or agentic AI behavior  
- Human-in-the-loop ownership and approval requirements  
- Governance principles designed to stand up to audit, review, and executive scrutiny  

These materials are intended to be **readable by non-technical stakeholders**, including program leaders, quality and governance teams, and executive reviewers.

---

## What this repository is not

This repository does **not** provide:

- AI models, algorithms, or training code  
- Autonomous or agentic systems  
- Enforcement tooling or implementation details  
- Client-specific delivery playbooks  
- Regulatory or legal advice  

All AI described here is **decision-support only**.

---

## Why this exists

Across regulated industries, AI adoption often fails not because of model performance, but because of **unclear accountability**.

Public industry discussions—including openly available webinars, articles, and conference materials hosted by firms such as **Syner-G**—have repeatedly surfaced common challenges:

- Decision paralysis at phase gates  
- Fragmented evidence across functions  
- Late discovery of misalignment  
- Risk-averse stakeholders unsure how AI fits into regulated workflows  

This repository responds to those *publicly discussed challenges* by formalizing a governance posture that makes AI:

- optional  
- constrained  
- auditable  
- subordinate to human judgment  

---

## Governance stance (core principles)

### 1. AI is never a decision-maker

AI systems may support analysis, but **cannot**:

- initiate decisions  
- approve or reject outcomes  
- override human judgment  
- act autonomously or agentically  

All decisions remain **human-owned**.

---

### 2. AI assistance must be explicit and reviewable

When used, AI outputs must be:

- intentionally invoked by a human  
- reviewable and editable  
- attributable to a specific decision context  
- explicitly approved or rejected by a named owner  

There is no path for silent or implicit influence.

---

### 3. Governance is separated from decision structure

This repository defines **AI governance boundaries only**.

It is designed to operate alongside—but not inside—decision systems such as **RGDS (Regulated Gate Decision Support)**, which define *how* decisions are recorded, evaluated, and owned.

This separation ensures:

- decisions remain valid without AI  
- AI use remains inspectable and reversible  
- governance can evolve independently of delivery tooling

## Repository contents

- **Non-Agentic AI Contract**  
  Formal statement of what AI is explicitly prohibited from doing  

- **What AI Will Not Do**  
  Client- and executive-facing clarification designed to reduce adoption risk  

- **Service-Line Governance Overview**  
  How constrained AI assistance fits into regulated consulting and delivery contexts  

Additional internal enforcement mechanisms and delivery playbooks are intentionally **out of scope** for this public repository.

---

## Intended audience

This repository is written for:

- Program and delivery leaders in regulated environments  
- Quality, compliance, and governance stakeholders  
- Executives responsible for phase-gate approvals  
- Consultants and analysts designing AI-assisted workflows  

It assumes familiarity with regulated delivery—not machine-learning research.

---

## Status

This repository is a **reference governance artifact**, not a production system.

It is published to support transparency, discussion, and defensible design—not to prescribe implementation.
