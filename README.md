# RGDS AI Governance

This repository defines the governance boundaries for AI-assisted decision support
in regulated, phase-gated environments.

It exists to ensure that artificial intelligence:
- supports human judgment
- never replaces decision authority
- remains auditable, explainable, and defensible

This repository is intentionally conservative.

---

## What This Repository Is

- A governance layer for AI-assisted decision support
- A source of truth for non-agentic AI boundaries
- A reference for regulated delivery teams
- A foundation for Syner-G’s AI service line playbooks

---

## What This Repository Is Not

- An AI agent framework
- An automation platform
- A decision-making system
- A substitute for expert judgment

---

## Core Artifacts

### Non-Agentic AI Contract
Located in `/contracts/`

Defines:
- what AI may do
- what AI must never do
- how human authority is preserved
- audit and escalation requirements

This contract governs all AI-assisted work delivered under this model.

---

### AI-Assisted RGDS Examples
Located in `/examples/`

Demonstrate:
- how AI assistance operates in practice
- how decisions remain human-owned
- how RGDS remains authoritative

Examples are illustrative and intentionally narrow.

---

## Relationship to RGDS

This repository is designed to be **adjacent to**, not embedded within,
the RGDS repository.

RGDS remains:
- non-agentic
- human-governed
- the authoritative decision record

AI assistance may support RGDS inputs,
but never alters RGDS decision authority.

---

## Status

This repository supports a pilot AI service line.
Boundaries may evolve only through explicit revision.
