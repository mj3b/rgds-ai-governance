# Example: AI-Assisted RGDS Decision  
**Example ID:** `rgds-dec-0003-ai-assisted-conditional-go`  
**Status:** Illustrative (Pilot)

---

## Decision Context

**Decision Type:** `conditional_go`  
**Phase Gate:** IND Readiness Review  
**Program Area:** Non-Clinical / Regulatory Integration  
**Decision Owner:** VP Regulatory Affairs (Human)  
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  

**Decision Question:**  
> Is the current non-clinical evidence package sufficient to proceed with IND submission **under defined conditions**, given late-arriving tox data and known dependency risk?

---

## Evidence Inputs (Human-Provided)

- GLP Repeat-Dose Tox Study (Draft Audited)
- Non-GLP Exploratory Safety Study
- Module 2.6 Draft Summaries
- Draft Investigator’s Brochure
- Vendor delivery timeline (tox final report ETA)
- Target Product Profile (internal)

All evidence sources were **human-selected** and **authoritative**.

---

## AI Assistance Declaration (Mandatory)

> **AI assistance was used in this decision.**  
> AI outputs were used **only to surface inconsistencies, dependencies, and precedent patterns**.  
> AI did **not** recommend a decision or assess regulatory acceptability.

---

## AI-Assisted Outputs (Bounded)

### 1. Dependency & Timing Analysis (AI-Supported)

AI highlighted that:

- Final GLP tox report delivery occurs **after** planned IND submission date
- Module 2.6 references draft tox conclusions in 3 locations
- IB language assumes final NOAEL confirmation not yet locked

**AI Output Classification:**  
☑ Dependency surfacing  
☑ Consistency check  
☑ Timeline risk flag  

**Prohibited actions NOT taken:**  
✗ No submission recommendation  
✗ No sufficiency judgment  

---

### 2. Pattern Comparison (AI-Supported)

AI compared current evidence posture against:

- 7 prior IND programs with similar tox maturity at submission
- Internal historical patterns (human-curated reference set)

**AI surfaced:**
- 5/7 precedents proceeded under **explicit conditional commitments**
- All 5 documented post-submission tox update plans

**AI Output Classification:**  
☑ Pattern surfacing  
☑ Historical context  

**Note:**  
AI did **not** assess acceptability or likelihood of FDA response.

---

### 3. Risk Signal Detection (AI-Supported)

AI flagged:

- Language divergence between IB Section 5 and Module 2.6.6 regarding margin of safety phrasing
- No new safety signal detected, but **terminology inconsistency** present

**AI Output Classification:**  
☑ Inconsistency detection  
☑ Risk visibility  

---

## Human Evaluation & Judgment (Required)

**Human Reviewers:**
- Regulatory Lead
- Non-Clinical Toxicologist
- Medical Writing Lead

**Human Conclusions:**

- Evidence is **directionally sufficient**
- Risk is **understood and bounded**
- Proceeding without conditions would be inappropriate
- Conditional submission with explicit commitments is acceptable

AI outputs were reviewed, challenged, and selectively accepted.

---

## Final Decision (Human-Owned)

**Decision:** `conditional_go`

**Rationale:**  
Proceed with IND submission **provided the following conditions are met and recorded**.

---

## Conditions (Explicit, Owned)

1. **Condition A — Tox Finalization**
   - Final GLP tox report to be submitted to FDA within X days post-IND
   - Regulatory owner assigned

2. **Condition B — Language Alignment**
   - IB and Module 2.6 language harmonized prior to publishing
   - Medical Writing owner assigned

3. **Condition C — FDA Communication**
   - Tox maturity and follow-up plan explicitly disclosed in cover letter

Failure to meet conditions triggers **mandatory re-review**.

---

## Accountability

- **Decision Owner:** VP Regulatory Affairs  
- **Condition Owners:** Named individuals  
- **AI Role:** Informational only  
- **Authority:** Human, singular, documented  

---

## Audit & Traceability

- AI assistance logged with timestamps
- Human acceptance recorded
- Decision rationale immutable post-approval
- RGDS decision log is authoritative
