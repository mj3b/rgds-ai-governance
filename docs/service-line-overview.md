# AI Governance in the Service-Line Context
**Constrained AI Assistance for Regulated Decision Support**

This document explains how AI governance operates within a **consulting and delivery service context**
when supporting decisions governed by **RGDS (Regulated Gate Decision Support)**.

It is written for **principal consultants, delivery leaders, and governance stakeholders**
responsible for designing, approving, and overseeing AI-assisted workflows in regulated environments.

---

## Executive Summary

AI governance within the service line exists to support **decision readiness**, not automation.

AI may accelerate analysis and preparation, but it **never replaces**:
- human judgment
- formal review
- governance escalation
- decision authority

The service line treats AI as a **bounded analytical capability**, operating under explicit governance covenants and always subordinate to RGDS decision records.

---

## Service-Line Positioning

Within regulated consulting and delivery work, AI is positioned as follows:

### What AI *Is* in the Service Line

| Role | Description |
|----|-------------|
| Analytical aid | Supports structured analysis and synthesis |
| Time-compression tool | Reduces manual effort in review-heavy workflows |
| Structured assistant | Helps prepare non-binding analytical drafts |

### What AI *Is Not* in the Service Line

| Explicitly excluded | Reason |
|--------------------|--------|
| Decision authority | Preserves human accountability |
| Execution engine | Prevents silent or automatic action |
| Expert substitute | Protects domain judgment |
| Governance mechanism | Keeps oversight human-led |

---

## Why Governance Comes First

In regulated delivery, failures rarely result from lack of expertise.

They typically arise from:

- implicit assumptions
- undocumented risk acceptance
- unclear reviewer accountability
- late discovery of cross-functional misalignment

AI can accelerate analysis, but **without governance it can amplify these failure modes**.

Governance establishes the conditions under which AI assistance is:

| Condition | Meaning |
|--------|--------|
| Permitted | Explicitly allowed, never assumed |
| Constrained | Bound by non-agentic covenants |
| Reviewable | Subject to human inspection and challenge |
| Reversible | Removable without invalidating decisions |

---

## Relationship to RGDS

AI governance and RGDS address **different concerns by design**.

### Separation of Responsibilities

| RGDS Defines | AI Governance Defines |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Decision artifacts | Whether AI may assist |
| Ownership & approval | What AI is prohibited from doing |
| Risk declaration | How human authority is preserved |
| Audit & reconstruction | Conditions for AI use |

Governance does **not** replace decision structure.  
Decision structure does **not** embed governance logic.

This separation ensures decisions remain valid even if AI is removed.

## How AI May Be Used in Service Delivery

When explicitly permitted, AI assistance may support:

| Permitted Use | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| Evidence summarization | Reduce review time without changing substance |
| Cross-document comparison | Surface inconsistencies or gaps |
| Gap identification | Highlight missing or misaligned inputs |
| Drafting support | Prepare non-binding analytical text |

### Mandatory Conditions

All AI outputs must be:

- explicitly invoked by a human
- reviewed by a named individual
- accepted, rejected, or revised deliberately
- traceable to a specific decision context

AI **never bypasses** service-line review, quality, or escalation processes.

---

## What Governance Does *Not* Provide

This governance framework intentionally excludes:

| Out of Scope | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------|
| Automation pathways | Prevents implicit execution |
| Agentic workflows | Maintains non-agentic posture |
| Delivery shortcuts | Avoids erosion of review discipline |
| Enforcement tooling | Keeps governance technology-agnostic |
| Client-specific procedures | Preserves general applicability |

Operationalization, tooling, and enforcement are handled **outside** this public governance layer.

---

## Service-Line Value Proposition

By establishing explicit AI boundaries, the service line gains:

| Benefit | Outcome |
|-------|---------|
| Faster gate alignment | Reduced decision friction |
| Lower regulatory risk | Clear accountability and traceability |
| Improved executive confidence | Transparent AI posture |
| Safer AI adoption | Bounded experimentation without trust erosion |

This enables teams to move faster **without sacrificing defensibility**.

## Status

This document is a **service-level governance overview**, not an implementation guide.

It exists to clarify **how AI fits** within regulated consulting and delivery work governed by RGDS—  
and, critically, where it does not.
