# AI Governance in the Service Line Context
**Constrained AI Assistance for Regulated Decision Support**

This document explains how AI governance operates within a **consulting and delivery service context** when supporting decisions governed by **RGDS (Regulated Gate Decision Support)**.

It is intended for principal consultants, delivery leaders, and governance stakeholders responsible for designing and overseeing AI-assisted workflows in regulated environments.

## Service-Line Positioning

AI governance in RGDS is designed to support **decision readiness**, not automation.

Within a service context, AI is treated as:
- an analytical aid
- a time-compression tool
- a structured assistant

It is **not** treated as:
- a decision authority
- an execution engine
- a substitute for expert judgment

---

## Why Governance Comes First

In regulated delivery, failures most often arise from:
- implicit assumptions
- undocumented risk acceptance
- unclear reviewer accountability
- late discovery of misalignment

AI can accelerate analysis, but without governance it can **amplify these failures**.

Governance establishes the conditions under which AI assistance is:
- permitted
- constrained
- reviewable
- reversible

---

## Relationship to RGDS

RGDS defines:
- the decision artifact
- ownership and approval roles
- evaluation and risk structure
- audit and reconstruction requirements

AI governance defines:
- whether AI may assist
- what AI is prohibited from doing
- how human ownership is preserved

These concerns are intentionally separated.

Governance does not replace decision structure.  
Decision structure does not embed governance logic.

## How AI Is Used in Service Delivery

When permitted, AI assistance in a service context may support:

- evidence summarization
- cross-document comparison
- gap identification
- structured drafting of non-binding analysis

All AI outputs require:
- explicit human invocation
- named human review
- documented disposition

AI assistance never bypasses service-line review, quality, or escalation processes.

---

## What Governance Does Not Provide

This governance framework does **not** provide:

- automation pathways
- agentic workflows
- delivery shortcuts
- enforcement tooling
- client-specific procedures

Operationalization, tooling, and enforcement are intentionally handled outside this public governance layer.

---

## Service-Line Value

By establishing explicit AI boundaries, the service line gains:

- faster alignment at decision gates
- reduced executive and regulatory risk
- clearer ownership and accountability
- safer adoption of AI assistance

This enables teams to move faster **without sacrificing defensibility**.

## Status

This document is a **service-level governance overview**.

It provides context and intent, not implementation guidance.
