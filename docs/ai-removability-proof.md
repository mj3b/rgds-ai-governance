# AI Removability Proof

RGDS decisions are valid with or without AI assistance.

If the `ai_assistance` block is removed from an RGDS decision record:

- Decision owner, reviewers, and authority scopes remain intact
- Evidence references and completeness assessments remain reviewable
- Risk statements, conditions, and mitigations remain enforceable
- Decision rationale and confidence remain human-authored
- Auditability and accountability are preserved

AI does not create, approve, advance, or close decisions.

AI removal does not invalidate past decisions, does not alter decision outcomes,
and does not compromise regulatory defensibility.

This property is intentional and enforced by design.
