# AI Decision Support: What AI Will Not Do (Client One-Pager)

This one-pager describes how Syner-G uses AI in regulated, phase-gated environments.
It is designed to build trust by making boundaries explicit.

AI is used to support human decision-making — not replace it.

---

## Non-Negotiable Boundaries

### AI will not make decisions
- AI will not issue Go / No-Go recommendations.
- AI will not approve submissions, protocols, or evidence packages.
- AI will not replace accountable decision owners.

**Humans own decisions. Always.**

---

### AI will not act autonomously
- AI will not initiate actions on your systems.
- AI will not execute changes, submissions, or communications.
- AI will not trigger downstream workflows without explicit human instruction.

AI outputs are **inputs**, not actions.

---

### AI will not hide uncertainty
- AI will not present guesses as facts.
- AI will not fabricate rationale, citations, or evidence.
- AI will not “smooth over” missing data.

If information is uncertain or missing, it is surfaced explicitly.

---

### AI will not modify authoritative records
- AI will not change source data.
- AI will not edit controlled documents without review.
- AI will not overwrite approved decisions.

All changes remain under your documented controls.

## What AI *Can* Do (Bounded Support)

When used, AI is limited to support functions such as:
- highlighting inconsistencies across documents
- surfacing missing inputs or dependencies
- summarizing large evidence sets for human review
- flagging contradictions between new findings and prior assumptions
- formatting information into structured, reviewable decision records

Every output is:
- reviewable
- challengeable
- discardable without penalty

---

## How We Keep This Defensible

### Human review is mandatory
AI-assisted outputs are not used until a named human reviewer:
- verifies the content,
- accepts or rejects it, and
- owns the outcome.

---

### Audit trails are preserved
For AI-assisted work, we maintain traceability that includes:
- what sources were used
- what output was generated
- who reviewed it
- what was accepted, changed, or rejected
- when the decision was finalized

---

### Governance remains the anchor
When RGDS is used, the decision record is the authority.
AI may help prepare decision context, but it does not determine outcomes.

---

## Bottom Line

Syner-G uses AI to reduce late-stage surprises and improve decision clarity —
while preserving:
- human authority
- regulatory defensibility
- auditability
- and trust

If a use case cannot meet these boundaries, we do not deploy it.
