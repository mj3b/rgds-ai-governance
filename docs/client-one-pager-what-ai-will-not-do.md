# What AI Will Not Do
**Clear, Explicit Boundaries for AI Assistance in RGDS-Governed Decisions**

This document defines **explicit limitations** on the use of AI in decisions governed by  
**RGDS (Regulated Gate Decision Support)**.

It is written for **executives, program leaders, quality reviewers, and regulated stakeholders**
who require unambiguous clarity on **where AI stops** in regulated, phase-gated decision environments.

---

## Executive Summary (One-Minute Read)

**AI may assist analysis.  
AI does not make decisions.**

Under RGDS governance:

- All decisions are **human-owned**
- All approvals are **human-approved**
- All accountability remains **human-accountable**

AI is a *supporting tool*, never a decision authority.

---

## Core Principle

> **AI can inform decisions, but cannot own them.**

At every phase gate:
- humans decide
- humans approve
- humans accept or reject risk

AI has **no decision authority** under any circumstance.

---

## What AI Will Not Do (At a Glance)

| Area | AI Will Not |
|----|-------------|
| Decision authority | Decide, approve, defer, or reject outcomes |
| Autonomy | Initiate actions or operate independently |
| Risk | Determine or silently accept risk posture |
| Governance | Replace escalation, review, or oversight |
| Evidence | Become evidence of record |
| Transparency | Operate without disclosure |
| Dependency | Become required for defensible decisions |

---

## AI Will Not Make Decisions

AI will not:

- decide gate outcomes (`go`, `conditional_go`, `no_go`)
- approve or reject deliverables
- defer decisions on behalf of humans
- replace human judgment at any decision point

**Decision authority always rests with named human owners.**

---

## AI Will Not Act Autonomously

AI will not:

- initiate workflows or downstream actions
- operate without explicit human invocation
- function as an autonomous or agentic system
- execute tasks without human review and disposition

There is **no permitted path** for autonomous or self-directed behavior.

---

## AI Will Not Override or Silence Humans

AI will not:

- override human reviewers or approvers
- resolve disagreements between stakeholders
- suppress dissenting views or alternatives
- bypass governance or escalation processes

Human outcomes such as:
- disagreement
- abstention
- conditional approval  

remain **valid and protected**.

---

## AI Will Not Determine Risk Posture

AI will not:

- accept or mitigate risk
- infer residual risk acceptance
- normalize uncertainty
- collapse unresolved assumptions into recommendations

**Risk posture must always be explicitly declared by humans.**

---

## AI Will Not Become Evidence of Record

AI outputs:

- are **not** evidence of record by default
- do **not** replace source documents, data, or reports
- cannot independently satisfy regulatory or quality requirements

AI may **support analysis**, but authoritative evidence remains human-reviewed source material.

---

## AI Will Not Operate Without Disclosure

AI will not:

- influence decisions invisibly
- introduce hidden assumptions or rationale
- operate in a manner that cannot be inspected or explained

All AI assistance must be:

| Requirement | Meaning |
|------------|--------|
| Visible | Clearly disclosed as AI-assisted |
| Attributable | Linked to a specific decision context |
| Reviewable | Open to inspection and challenge |

---

## AI Will Not Create Dependency

Decisions governed under RGDS must remain defensible **if all AI outputs are removed**.

AI may accelerate work, but must **never** become:

- a prerequisite for approval
- a justification for reduced oversight
- a substitute for human accountability

---

## Why These Limits Exist

In regulated environments, the primary risk is **not incorrect analysis**.

The primary risk is **unclear accountability**.

These boundaries ensure that:

- ownership remains explicit
- governance remains auditable
- decisions remain defensible at the moment they are made

---

## Status

This document is a **governance clarification**, not a technical specification.

It exists to ensure shared understanding of **what AI will not do** in
RGDS-governed decisions.
